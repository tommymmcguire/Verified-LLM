# Project Idea: Generative AI Chatbot for Verified Carbon
Objective: Develop an AI chatbot that can answer questions about Verified Carbon and direct air capture. The chatbot will also generate images to help users visualize the processes and concepts related to carbon capture and storage.

## Plan and Execution:
Week 1: Introduction and Planning
Research and Define Scope:

Identify Information Needs: Determine the types of questions users might have about Verified Carbon and direct air capture.
Example questions:
* What is direct air capture?
* How does Verified Carbon ensure effective carbon storage?
* What are the environmental benefits of direct air capture?


## Data Collection: Gather relevant information, including company details, direct air capture processes, and visual aids that can be used to generate images.
Sources include company documents, scientific articles, and existing visual content on carbon capture.
Develop Project Proposal:

## Objectives: Create a chatbot that provides informative responses and visual aids.
* Methodology: Use a combination of natural language processing (NLP) for understanding questions and generating responses, and image generation tools for creating visuals.
* Expected Outcomes: A functional chatbot that enhances user understanding of Verified Carbon and direct air capture.

## Design Chatbot Architecture:
* Capabilities: The chatbot will respond to text queries and generate images.
* Platform: Decide whether to deploy the chatbot on a web-based platform or as a mobile app.
* Tools: Consider using frameworks like Rasa or Dialogflow for NLP and DALL-E for image generation.
